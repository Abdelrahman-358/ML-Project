## 📦 Requirements

Before running the project, install the required Python packages.

### 🐍 1. Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- On **Windows**:
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On **macOS/Linux**:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

---

### 📥 2. Install Dependencies

Create a file named `requirements.txt` in the project folder with the following content:

```text
tensorflow
```

Then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> 💡 If you only need TensorFlow, you can also install it directly with:
> ```bash
> pip install tensorflow
> ```

---

### 🚀 3. Run the Project

Once the environment is ready and dependencies are installed, run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting

- If you see this error:
  ```
  ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'
  ```
  → It means TensorFlow is not installed. Run:
  ```bash
  pip install tensorflow
  ```

- Use `python --version` to make sure you're using Python 3.8 or newer.
